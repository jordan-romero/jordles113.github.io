Hi all, 
        My name is Jordan and I live in Austin, Texas. I have been in social services for the last ten years and majored in psychology. I have spent the last ten years interacting with people, helping them overcome obstacles, solving seemingly unsolvable problems (i.e. finding a great job for an individual with a severe felonious history). I had never even thought about coding or software engineering. I was working at a local crisis center and a coworker’s husband was an entrepreneur and had developed an application we were testing out (it got us free lunch so we were very much into the idea of helping out). ;) As I became closer to these two individuals, they told me about software engineering and coding bootcamps. I started looking into it innocuously, “I couldn’t possibly learn that stuff. It’s so hard” or “I have no basic framework or knowledge. I wouldn’t even know where to start” or even “How silly of me to entertain this thought.” For some reason though, the idea kept coming back to me. I would be getting ready for my day and just look into another camp or look at some prep materials that were free.* Those first few lessons were intoxicating. I was hooked!* I called my friend’s husband to discuss my new found excitement and he sent me three links to schools he has personally hired from. Flatiron was the top of the list! I immediately dove into Bootcamp Prep and applied as soon as I could. I am so grateful to have discovered a new passion and a new journey to embark on. I feel that my current skills, problem solving and determination to succeed despite the difficulties, will help me complete this program and one day I hope to be able to volunteer my new skills to these agencies like the ones that I have spent the last ten years with. Ya’ll their websites need the help! ;)
